# Project Description
This project involves building a responsive property listing page using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The application will display a collection of luxury properties with filtering capabilities, a hero section, and proper layout organization. The page will be fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes while maintaining a clean, user-friendly interface.

# Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will:

Implement responsive web design principles using Tailwind CSS
Create reusable React components for layout (Header, Footer, Layout)
Work with TypeScript interfaces for type safety
Structure a Next.js application with proper component organization
Render dynamic data from an array of objects
Implement filtering functionality for property listings
Practice best practices in component composition and styling
Learn to break down UI mockups into logical components

# Requirements
Technical Requirements
Use Next.js as the React framework
Implement TypeScript for type checking
Style components exclusively with Tailwind CSS
Create responsive layouts that work on mobile, tablet, and desktop
Structure components in a logical folder hierarchy
Use functional components with proper TypeScript typing

0. Develop Responsive Booking Detail Page with User Input and Payment Processing
Objective:

In this milestone, you will implement the Booking Detail Page based on the provided mockup. The page should allow users to enter their contact and payment details, review their booking information, and confirm the booking. This page will be responsive and styled using Tailwind CSS.

By the end of this milestone, you will have created a functional and responsive booking page where users can input details and proceed with the booking process.


## Project Objectives
The objective of this milestone is to deploy the ALX Listing App (Airbnb clone) to a cloud hosting platform so that it is publicly accessible.

By completing this milestone, you will:

`Configure your Next.js application for production.
Deploy the app to Vercel (recommended) or an alternative platform like Netlify.
Ensure all API integrations work correctly in the deployed environment.
Verify that the app is fully responsive and functional in a live environment.
Best Practices
Environment Variables: Ensure all API endpoints and sensitive keys are stored in environment variables (.env.local).
Optimized Build: Run npm run build to check for errors before deployment.
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS): If your API is hosted separately, ensure CORS is configured to allow requests from your deployed domain.
Performance Optimization:
Use Next.js Image Optimization.
Enable caching where applicable.
Error Handling: Ensure proper error boundaries and fallback UI for failed API calls.
Note:
Ensure your app is publicly accessible via the provided URL.
Double-check API integrations in the live environment.
Submit your repository and README.md with the live link before the deadline.`
